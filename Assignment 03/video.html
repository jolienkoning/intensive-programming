    	<p>
    		At first I didn't understand the meaning of the before and after pseudo element.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		You choose in CSS before or/and after which element you want to add something. For example, when you need a dollar sign in front of every sentence, or a music note. 
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		The point is that it will be in front of every element in which you want it to be. 
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		Right now I've used a lot of different paragraphs, and put a BEFORE and AFTER on every paragraph.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		You can choose the design you want!
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		One more important thing: the before and after pseudo adds adds text before and after an element without adding value to the content in the HTML.
